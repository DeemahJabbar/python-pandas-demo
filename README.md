## Getting Started

To get started with this demo, you'll need to fork the repository and create a Codespace. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Python and Pandas

### Forking the Repository

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub: [https://github.com/yourusername/python-pandas-demo](https://github.com/yourusername/python-pandas-demo)
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the forked repository.
4. Wait for the forking process to complete. You will be redirected to your forked repository.

### Creating a Codespace

1. On your forked repository page, click on the "Code" button.
2. In the Codespaces tab, click on the "Create codespace on main" button.
3. Wait for the Codespace to be created and loaded. This may take a few minutes.
4. Once the Codespace is ready, you will see a web-based version of Visual Studio Code.

## Running the Script

1. In the Codespace, open the `pd.py` file.
2. Review the code and familiarize yourself with the data analysis tasks performed.
3. Open the terminal in the Codespace by clicking on the "Terminal" menu and selecting "New Terminal".
4. In the terminal, run the following command to execute the script:
   ```
   python pd.py
   ```
5. The script will load the `dummy_user_data.csv` file, perform the specified analysis tasks, and display the results in the terminal.

## File Descriptions

- `pd.py`: The Python script that demonstrates data analysis using Pandas.
- `dummy_user_data.csv`: The CSV file containing the dataset used in the demo.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the demo.

## Data Analysis Tasks

The `pd.py` file performs the following data analysis tasks:

1. Loading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Calculating the average login duration.
3. Finding the most active day based on the number of records.
4. Identifying the user with the most page visits.
5. Calculating the average error count per session.

Feel free to modify the script and add your own analysis tasks to further explore the dataset.
