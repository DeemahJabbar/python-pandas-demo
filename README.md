## Getting Started

To get started with this demo, you'll need to fork the repository and create a Codespace. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Python and Pandas

### Forking the Repository

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub: [https://github.com/yourusername/python-pandas-demo](https://github.com/yourusername/python-pandas-demo)
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the forked repository.
4. Wait for the forking process to complete. You will be redirected to your forked repository.

### Creating a Codespace

1. On your forked repository page, click on the "Code" button.
2. In the Codespaces tab, click on the "Create codespace on main" button.
3. Wait for the Codespace to be created and loaded. This may take a few minutes.
4. Once the Codespace is ready, you will see a web-based version of Visual Studio Code.

## Running the Script

1. In the Codespace, open the `pd.py` file.
2. Review the code and familiarize yourself with the data analysis tasks performed.
3. Open the terminal in the Codespace by clicking on the "Terminal" menu and selecting "New Terminal".
4. In the terminal, run the following command to execute the script:
   ```
   python pd.py
   ```
5. The script will load the `dummy_user_data.csv` file, perform the specified analysis tasks, and display the results in the terminal.

## File Descriptions

- `pd.py`: The Python script that demonstrates data analysis using Pandas.
- `dummy_user_data.csv`: The CSV file containing the dataset used in the demo.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the demo.

## Data Analysis Tasks

The `pd.py` file performs the following data analysis tasks:

1. Loading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Calculating the average login duration.
3. Finding the most active day based on the number of records.
4. Identifying the user with the most page visits.
5. Calculating the average error count per session.

Feel free to modify the script and add your own analysis tasks to further explore the dataset.

## Output

1. `Basic Statistical Summary:`
   - This line is just a header indicating that the following output provides a basic statistical summary of the data.

2. `Date User_ID Login_Duration Pages_Visited Error_Count`
   - This line represents the column names of the DataFrame. It shows that the DataFrame has columns named 'Date', 'User_ID', 'Login_Duration', 'Pages_Visited', and 'Error_Count'.

3. `count 100 100.000000 100.000000 100.000000 100.000000`
   - The 'count' row shows the number of non-null values in each column.
   - In this case, all columns have 100 non-null values, indicating that there are no missing values in the dataset.

4. `mean 2023-02-19 12:00:00 1460.080000 33.397307 9.630000 1.930000`
   - The 'mean' row shows the average value for each numerical column.
   - For the 'Date' column, it shows the mean timestamp value.
   - The 'User_ID' column is not included in the mean calculation since it is likely a categorical or non-numeric column.
   - The average login duration is 1460.08 (unit depends on the original data), the average number of pages visited is 33.397307, and the average error count is 1.93.

5. `min 2023-01-01 00:00:00 1009.000000 5.878905 1.000000 0.000000`
   - The 'min' row shows the minimum value for each numerical column.
   - The earliest date in the 'Date' column is 2023-01-01 00:00:00.
   - The minimum login duration is 1009.0, the minimum number of pages visited is 5.878905, and the minimum error count is 0.

6. `25% 2023-01-25 18:00:00 1186.750000 19.732347 5.750000 1.000000`
   - The '25%' row represents the first quartile (25th percentile) value for each numerical column.
   - 25% of the dates are earlier than or equal to 2023-01-25 18:00:00.
   - 25% of the login durations are less than or equal to 1186.75, 25% of the pages visited are less than or equal to 19.732347, and 25% of the error counts are less than or equal to 1.

7. `50% 2023-02-19 12:00:00 1448.500000 32.035095 9.000000 2.000000`
   - The '50%' row represents the median (50th percentile) value for each numerical column.
   - The median date is 2023-02-19 12:00:00.
   - The median login duration is 1448.5, the median number of pages visited is 32.035095, and the median error count is 2.

8. `75% 2023-03-16 06:00:00 1725.000000 46.827497 14.000000 3.000000`
   - The '75%' row represents the third quartile (75th percentile) value for each numerical column.
   - 75% of the dates are earlier than or equal to 2023-03-16 06:00:00.
   - 75% of the login durations are less than or equal to 1725.0, 75% of the pages visited are less than or equal to 46.827497, and 75% of the error counts are less than or equal to 3.

9. `max 2023-04-10 00:00:00 1959.000000 59.595056 19.000000 4.000000`
   - The 'max' row shows the maximum value for each numerical column.
   - The latest date in the 'Date' column is 2023-04-10 00:00:00.
   - The maximum login duration is 1959.0, the maximum number of pages visited is 59.595056, and the maximum error count is 4.

10. `std NaN 275.707673 15.755955 5.240971 1.451262`
    - The 'std' row shows the standard deviation for each numerical column.
    - The standard deviation is not calculated for the 'Date' column, resulting in 'NaN' (Not a Number).
    - The standard deviation of the login duration is 275.707673, the standard deviation of the pages visited is 15.755955, and the standard deviation of the error count is 1.451262.

These statistics provide a summary of the distribution and central tendency of the numerical columns in the DataFrame. They help in understanding the range, average, and dispersion of the values in each column.
